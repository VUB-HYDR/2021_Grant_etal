## For users
This repository includes the processing and plotting scripts used in Grant et al, 2020. ISIMIP 2b global lakes outputs are largely post-processed in the bash scripts. Additional statistical analyses and plotting are done with python.

For the python code, parts 1-4 are assigned to figures 1-4 in the article. Each part has a main script for calling the processing of these plots. These main scripts also contain commands for producing SI figures which are related to these sections. The folder "eval" is now produces plots for the model and ERA5-Land evaluation.

Part 2 processes the results of our detection and attribution analysis using adapted python code from [pinplex](https://github.com/pinplex/PyDnA).
